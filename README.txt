USAGE OF MVVM TEMPLATES

(Written in Swift 4.2)
These templates were created in order to prevent you from writing much boilerplate code in your Swift projects.
The folder contains 3 templates for different types of modules: 
Simple View Controller
View Controller with TableView
ViewController with CollectionView 

Follow these simple instructions to use the template in your project:
1. Drag the folder with a certain template into your project.
2. Rename the folder as you need.
3. Add the folder through «Add Files to ‘Your_Project’…». Check «Create groups» in adding menu.
4. Replace all _TEMPLATE_ words in files with your ViewController name (Use Cmd + F  —> «Find & Replace»)
5. Replace _TEMPLATE_ words in file names.

You are ready to go!
5 simple operations instead of hours of manual creating.
